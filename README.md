# SpatialAnalysisofSacredSites

The Shakti Pithas represent one of Hinduism's most significant sacred geographical networks, consisting of temples and shrines dedicated to the divine feminine energy. According to Hindu mythology, these sacred sites emerged from the tragic tale of Sati and Shiva, where after Sati's self-immolation at her father Daksha's yajna, Lord Shiva carried her body while performing the cosmic tandava dance across the universe. To restore cosmic balance and calm the grieving Shiva, Lord Vishnu used his Sudarshana Chakra to dismember Sati's body, with the various parts falling at different locations across the Indian subcontinent. The Brahmanda Purana mentions 64 Shakti Pithas across Greater India, though different texts cite varying numbers ranging from 51 to 108 sacred sites. 

These locations span across present-day India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and parts of Southern Tibet, creating a vast network of interconnected sacred spaces. Each Shakti Pitha is associated with a specific body part of the goddess and is accompanied by a manifestation of Lord Shiva as Bhairava.
